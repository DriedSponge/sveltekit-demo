## Svelte Demo

This is just a demo svelte app I created for the CS Club to demonstrate it's
ease of use.

This app is statically generated. That means that the HTML is
pre-rendered and there is no server side required. This also means that there is no
dynamic content. You can read more about static and dynamic websites [here](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/static-site-generator/).

You can use your arrow keys to move back and forth between "slides".
