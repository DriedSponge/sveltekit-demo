## Svelte Demo

This is just a demo svelte app I created for the CS Club to demonstrate it's
ease of use.

This app is statically generated. That means that the HTML is
pre-rendered and there is no server side required. This also means that there is no
dynamic content. You can read more about static and dynamic websites [here](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/static-site-generator/).

If you would like to preview the site, the url is https://sveltekit-demo-3gi.pages.dev/.
You can use your arrow keys to move back and forth between "slides".

The URL is weird because I used Cloudflare pages to host it. I was originally going to use GitHub
pages, but it was a pain in the butt to set up. I could set it to my own custom domain, but I am 
blocked by the district.

I found using Cloudflare pages way easier compared to GitHub pages. It's way faster too.
